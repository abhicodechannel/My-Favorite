     Hello! I am Abhinaba sen. I study in 6 class. My school Name Is Navy children school,Vishakapatnam.
            My Favorite Hobby Is coding.Coding is My passion. I also like to play games. I like coding becuase with coding I learn many things. I have made many websites, app and games with coding.Coding makes me think how to solve problem of other people and problem with nature. I code to solve the problems by making apps and website.Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.
